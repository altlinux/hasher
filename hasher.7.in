.TH HASHER "7" "July 2004" "hasher version @VERSION@" "ALT Linux"
.SH NAME
hasher \- modern safe package build technology
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh
.IR "" [ options ]
.I <path-to-workdir>
.IR <package> ...
.SH RATIONALE
Long ago, when instrumental OS distributions made by few developers was
small enough to be placed on single CD with sources, there were no real
package build technology.  Developers built their packages in host system
created by installing whole OS distribution.

Nowadays instrumental OS distributions are made by dozens of developers.
They are too large to be installed wholly.  As result, traditional
package build scheme in host system no longer fits the requirements:
it is insecure, unsafe and awkward.
.SH REQUIREMENTS
Modern package build technology should:
.TP
1.
not lower host system security;
.TP
2.
protect itself from attacks installed by packages;
.TP
3.
protect package builds from attacks installed by other packages;
.TP
4.
ensure reliability of build results;
.TP
5.
provide reasonable performance.
.SH ARCHITECTURE
The
.B hasher
architecture is based on triple\-user model: caller user
.IR "" ( C )
and two unprivileged pseudousers; first one
.IR "" ( R )
emulates root in generated build environment, second one
.IR "" ( U )
emulates regular user who builds software.

User switch between caller user and helper users is handled by special
privileged program
.BR hasher\-priv (8),
executed by
.BR sudo (8)
utility.  It is written with extreme caution to defend from attacks
installed by unprivileged users.  This helper is also used to purge
processes left after pseudousers, to create device files, and to
control resources allocated for unprivileged processes to defend from
DoS\-attacks.

In general, the way of source package in hasher during build looks
as follows:
.TP
1.
User
.I C
generates environment (aptbox) for apt.
.TP
2.
Build environment probably left by previous builds should be completely
removed.  The removal is done sequential: inside build chroot by user
.IR U ,
inside build chroot by user
.I R
and finally outside chroot by user
.IR C .
.TP
3.
User
.I C
generates new build chroot framework, which consists of helper directories
and helper statically linked programs:
.BR ash (1),
.BR find (1)
and
.BR cpio (1).
Basic device files are also created at this point with help of 
.BR hasher\-priv (8).
These devices are necessary for build environment and safe for host
system.
.TP
4.
Basic install environment should be generated; this environment contains
everything necessary for regular package installs.
User
.I C
using apt determines set of packages requires to generate install environment.
User
.I R
using static helper programs unpacks these packages.
.TP
5.
Basic build environment should be generated; this environment contains
tools required for every package build.
User
.I C
using apt determines set of packages, user
.I R
installs them.
.TP
6.
Build environment for this particular package should be generated.
User
.I U
fetches package build dependencies, user
.I C
using apt determines set of packages to install, and user
.I R
installs them.
.TP
7.
User
.I U
executes the package build.
.PP
These scheme designed to eliminate attacks of form
.IR U "->" R ,
.IR U "->" C ,
.IR R "->" C ,
and all attacks targeted to root.

To increase performance essential when building a lot of packages,
.B hasher
does caching of the basic build environment.  It allows to skip steps 4 and 5.
