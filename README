1. Installation

  In order to prepare package hasher to use by <user>, you must add pair
  of special satellite users.  Run as root
  # hasher-useradd <user>

2. Usage

  The package hasher consists of several low-level utilities placed in
  /usr/share/hasher/, and high-level utility, /usr/bin/hsh.

  Example of use:
  $ hasher workdir path/to/foobar-1.0.src.rpm

  Working directory ("workdir" in example above) MUST exist.

  Working directory shouldn't contain self-made files or directories
  with names "aptbox" and "chroot".

  During the work hasher creates auto repository, workdir/repo.
  Result of successful build will be placed into this repository.

  Useful options:
    --no-stuff
    Do not use packages from auto repository in build system.
    By default, auto repository will be used as well as system repository.

    --nprocs=NUMBER
    Number of CPUs to use.
    By default, number of CPUs is calculated using /proc/stat data.

    --contents-index-all=INDEX
    Path to file with complete package contents index, e.g.
    path/to/Sisyphus/i586/base/contents_index; necessary for proper
    binary package dependencies calculation.
    By default, no package contents indeces will be used.

    -v, --verbose
    Print a message for each action.  Useful for tracing and/or
    getting detailed progress information.

  See "hsh --help" for detailed information about valid options.

3. Requirements.

  Filesystem where workdir is located should not be mounted with
  "noexec" or "nodev" options.

  Package repository used for creating build system must provide
  following packages:
  fakeroot >= 0:0.7.3 (required for proper TCB support);
  rpm-build >= 0:4.0.4-alt21 (required for proper package contents
                              indeces support).

  Only local source methods (i.e. file and copy) are supported.
