1. Installation

  In order to prepare package hasher to use by <user>, you must add pair
  of special satellite users.  Run as root
  # hasher-useradd <user>

2. Usage

  The package hasher consists of several low-level utilities placed in
  /usr/share/hasher/, and high-level utility, /usr/bin/hsh.

  Example of use:
  $ hasher workdir path/to/foobar-1.0.src.rpm

  Working directory ("workdir" in example above) MUST exist.
  During the work hasher creates auto repository, workdir/repo.
  Result of successful build will be placed into this repository.

  Useful options:
    --no-stuff
    Do not use packages from auto repository in build system.
    By default, auto repository will be used as well as system repository.

    --nprocs=NUMBER
    Number of CPUs to use.
    By default, number of CPUs is calculated using /proc/stat data.

    --contents-index-all=INDEX
    Path to file with complete package contents index, e.g.
    path/to/Sisyphus/i586/base/contents_index; necessary for proper
    binary package dependencies calculation.
    By default, no package contents indeces will be used.

    -v, --verbose
    Print a message for each action.  Useful for tracing and/or getting
    detailed progress information.

  See "hsh --help" for detailed information about valid options.
