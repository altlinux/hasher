2. BASIC HASHER

2.1. What is hasher?

   Hasher is a modern safe package building technology.
   In general, it inputs a source package and outputs binary packages.

2.2. What is hasher not?

   Hasher is designed for building packages.  It is neither a package
   repository (in spite of the builtin repository it maintains) nor an
   universal chroot creation tool (in spite of the build environments
   it generates).

2.3. Where can I learn more about hasher?

   There is hasher(7) manpage which describes hasher architecture.
   It references other useful manpages you might want to study.
   There is a README file nearby.
   And, of course, there are search engines.

3. WHY ISN'T THIS WORKING?

3.1. Problems accessing privileged helpers.

3.1.1 How to make hasher work? Every invocation ends up with the following:
	Components: hasher
	Processing pkglists... hasher done
	Processing srclists...  hasher done
	Creating component releases... hasher done
	Creating global release file... done
	Appending MD5Sum... hasher done
	All your base are belong to us!!!
	hsh-mkchroot: cannot access getugid1 helper.

  In order to prepare package hasher to be used by USER, a pair of special
  satellite users must be added.  The system administrator should run
	# hasher-useradd USER

  This command creates two additional satellite users, USER_a and
  USER_b, and adds USER to groups: hashman, USER_a and USER_b.

  See hasher-useradd(8) for details.

3.1.2 I've created satellite users according to instructions, but still
   getting the same error.  Why?

   You have to re-login to gain new credentials.

3.1.3 Well, I've logged in, now it reports:
	hasher-priv: /: bad perms: 757
	hsh-mkchroot: getugid1 failed.

   You file system permissions are broken, you really should repair your
   operating system as soon as possible.

3.2. Workdir prefix mismatch.

3.2.1 When I run
	hsh /path/to/workdir path/to/package.src.rpm
      hasher fails with:
	hasher-priv: /path/to/workdir/chroot: prefix mismatch, working directory should start with $HOME
	hsh-mkchroot: failed to make devices.

   By default, hasher is configured to create working directories inside
   $HOME or /tmp/.private only.  This is a security sensitive parameter.
   System administrator can change this default, either systemwide or
   personally for you.
   In the first case, change parameter "prefix" in the systemwide config
   file /etc/hasher-priv/system to /path/to/workdir.
   In the second case, add the line
	prefix=/path/to/workdir
   to per-user config file /etc/hasher-priv/user.d/$USER.

------------------------------

4. HOW TO?

4.1. Parallel build.

4.1.1 Is there any way to build packages in different locations
   simultaneously?

   Yes, there is.

   First, an additional pseudouser pair should be created by hasher-useradd
   for each additional parallel build.
   Second, you have to pass subconfig identifier to hsh.

   For example,
   # hasher-useradd --number=1 --names=joe_a1:joe_b1
   $ hsh --number=1 /path/to/workdir1 package.src.rpm

4.2. Proc filesystem and pseudo terminals.

4.2.1 Is there any way to use proc filesystem inside chroot while building
   the package?

   Yes, there is.

   First, hasher-priv should be configured to allow mounting /proc inside
   chroot, either systemwide or personally for the user.  Add the line
	allowed_mountpoints=/proc
   either to the systemwide config file /etc/hasher-priv/system or
   to the per-user config file /etc/hasher-priv/user.d/$USER.

   Second, the package you are going to build should include /proc
   in its build dependencies, e.g.
	BuildPreReq: /proc
   Alternatively, at least one of packages installed into the build
   environment should include /proc in its dependencies.

   Third, hsh should be run with parameter --mountpoints=/proc.

4.2.2 Is there any way to create pseudoterminals and use them inside
   chroot while building the package?

   Yes, there is.

   First, hasher-priv should be configured to allow terminal device files
   creation and mounting /dev/pts inside chroot, either systemwide or
   personally for the user.  Add two lines:
	allow_ttydev=yes
	allowed_mountpoints=/dev/pts
   either to the systemwide config file /etc/hasher-priv/system or
   to the per-user config file /etc/hasher-priv/user.d/$USER.

   Second, the package you are going to build should include /dev/pts
   in its build dependencies, e.g.
	BuildPreReq: /dev/pts
   Alternatively, at least one of packages installed into the build
   environment should include /dev/pts in its dependencies.

   Third, hsh should be run with parameter --mountpoints=/dev/pts.

4.3. Native shell.

4.3.1 Is there any way to run a shell with a regular terminal inside chroot?

   Yes, there is.

   You should understand that building packages and running shell are
   incompatible tasks.  Hasher is designed for the first one, however,
   you can use it for the second one, too.

   For example, this command
   $ hsh-shell
   will run bash as a login shell with stdin, stdout and stderr associated
   with the pseudoterminal created by hasher.

   If the user is allowed to create tty devices and mount /dev/pts inside
   build chroot, this command
   $ hsh-shell --mountpoints=/dev/pts
   will create tty devices and mount /dev/pts inside the build chroot in a
   temporary mount namespace, and execute bash as a login shell with stdin,
   stdout and stderr associated with the pseudoterminal created by hasher.
