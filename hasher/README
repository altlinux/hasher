1. Prepare to work.

  In order to prepare package hasher to be used by USER, a pair of special
  satellite users have to be added.  The system administrator should run
	# hasher-useradd USER

  This command creates two additional satellite users, USER_a and
  USER_b, and adds USER to groups: hashman, USER_a and USER_b.

  See hasher-useradd(8) manpage for details.

  Note that USER have to (re)login to gain new credentials.

2. Usage.

  The package hasher contains one high-level utility - hsh(1),
  and several low-level utilities:
  hsh-initroot(1), hsh-install(1), hsh-mkchroot(1), hsh-rebuild(1),
  hsh-rmchroot(1), hsh-run(1), hsh-shell(1), mkaptbox(1).

  Example of use:
  $ hsh path/to/foobar-1.0.src.rpm

  Working directory ("$HOME/hasher" by default) MUST exist.

  Working directory should not contain self-made files or directories
  with reserved names "aptbox", "cache", "chroot", "pid" and "repo".

  During the work hasher creates there a subdirectory named "repo"
  to maintain the working repository.  The results of successful builds
  will be placed into this repository.

  Most useful options:
    --without-stuff
    Do not use packages from the auto repository in the build system.
    By default, the auto repository will be used as well as the system
    repository.

    --nprocs=NUMBER
    Number of CPUs to use.
    By default, the number of CPUs is calculated using /proc/stat data.

    -v, --verbose
    Print a message for each action.  Useful for tracing and/or
    getting detailed progress information.

  See hsh(1) manpage for detailed information about valid options.

3. Requirements.

  File system where workdir is located should not be mounted with
  "noexec" option.

  Package repository used for creating a build system must provide
  the following packages:
    fakeroot >= 0:0.7.3
      (required for proper TCB support);
    fakeroot >= 0:1.2-alt3
      (required for --save-fakeroot support);
    rpm-build >= 0:4.0.4-alt21
      (required for proper package contents indices support);
    sisyphus_check >= 0:0.7.3
      (required for executing sisyphus_check inside chroot);
    kernel-headers-common >= 1.1.4-alt1
      (required for "adjust_kernel_headers --first" support).

4. Caveats and limitations.

  Depending on the age of the package repository, apt installed in your host
  system will or will not work properly.  In case of essential differences
  between apt versions in the host system and the repository, consider using
  --apt-prefix option.
